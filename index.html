This tool can be useful for games like Pictionary or MadLibs. Since the words are random, this helps to keep a game like Pictionary fair for all those playing. For a game like MadLibs, it can help kids improve their vocabulary by generating words they may not have ever considered to fill in the blank spaces. The tool has the potential to help with any word game that doesn't require a specific word.
